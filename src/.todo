// get the snake direction state working  
  // automatically choose a random direction when you initialize app
  // respond to arrow keypresses → change direction
  // and thennnnn get div to respond to the directions and actually move in respective direction
// add "fruit" dynamics to game
  // generate fruit on initialization in random "tile" position
  // whenever we go over fruit, randomly generate another position that isn't the position of snake
  // maybe use array structure for snake (array of arrays) → outer array is length and inner arrays are x,y coordinates of each "piece"
  // then, add "length" to snake when it travels over fruit (add another position)
    // when snake "hits itself" (if at any time, next coordinate position is included in outer array, then "dead")
    // 
// 
// add variability for boundaries
  // first, make snake "die" (end game) when head of snake hits boundary (x → goes under left or over right boundary) vice versa for y
  // then, add functionality for "edge overflow" of snake (it passes the right boundary and continues on left)
